            hits the spot. But it is not the best summer drink. Nothing compares to the

             that embodies the sourness of lemons combined with the sweetness of strawberries. But

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
            <li> 12 Fresh Strawberries, hliled and quarted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of sugar (I prefer raw sugar)</li>
            <li>7 cups of water, divided</li>
            <li>3/3 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>1.5 cups of fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>3 ice cubes</li>
       </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix strawberries with 1/3 cup of sugar. Let this sit for 5-10 mins. This 
                    releases the juices from the strawberries. We want that sweet juice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once water is to a boil, add in 1/3 cup of sugar. Cook and stir sugar mixture until
                    it is dissolved, roughly 5 mins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove heat from saucepan from heat and stir in ice cubes. We want to cool down our sugar
                    mixture before we combine everthing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In pitcher stir together remaining water, fresh squeezed lemon juice, sweetend strawberrie,
                    and cooled down sugar mixture
                </li>
            </ol>
